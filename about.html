          <p>Ahh-Yum was born out of a longing to have home-cooked comfort food whenever and wherever.</p>
          <img src="ahhyum_logo.png" alt="logo" style="width:20%;">
          <p>The warm aroma of galangal swimming in a pool of santan, the tenderness of a single soft-poached
            egg resting in the midst of fragrant steamed rice, and fresh cut coriander resting regally on top sealing in all the goodness beneath it.
            We’ve been on a long search for something that would merge our traditional tastebuds with the
            modern lifestyles we were leading. Something on-the-go, takes little to no hassle to obtain,
            but with all the innate goodness and quality of home-cooked food. Turns out, there are so many of us who hold on to a bit of tradition, in some form or another, in all the hustle and bustle of modern life. This fusion makes up our identity.</p>
          <p>Thus Ahh-Yum came about with its strong Malaysian frontliners. That is not to say that we have neglected those who are more colourful in their gastronomic choices- our Western menu is a (kon)fusion- and that’s definitely a part of our Malaysian-ness!</p>
          <p>We believe that every morsel counts in the making of a good meal. At Ahh-Yum, we’ve dedicated our mission to serving only quality food. Every ingredient is scrutinized from the second they are sourced to the time they are placed on the wok up to when they are served on your table right in front of you. And true to our mission, we are: Halal. Freshly-cooked. Nostalgic. With no added MSG, preservatives or artificial colouring.</p>
          <p>Love, <br> Maria, Rossana, Alya.</p>
